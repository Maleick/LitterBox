## Overview

LitterBox provides a controlled sandbox environment designed for security professionals to develop and test payloads. This platform allows red teams to:

* Test evasion techniques against modern detection techniques
* Validate detection signatures before field deployment
* Analyze malware behavior in an isolated environment
* Keep payloads in-house without exposing them to external security vendors
* Ensure payload functionality without triggering production security controls

The platform includes LLM-assisted analysis capabilities through the LitterBoxMCP server, offering advanced analytical insights using natural language processing technology.

**Note**: While designed primarily for red teams, LitterBox can be equally valuable for blue teams by shifting perspective – using the same tools in their malware analysis workflows.

## Configuration

All settings are stored in `Config/config.yaml`. Edit this file to:

- Change server settings (host/port)
- Set allowed file types
- Configure analysis tools
- Adjust timeouts
- Configure remote execution targets under `analysis.remote`

## Remote Windows Execution

LitterBox can run on Linux and execute scanners on remote Windows hosts over Tailscale using transport-aware remoting (`ssh` and `winrm`) without a custom agent service.

- Configure targets in `Config/config.yaml` under `analysis.remote.targets`
- Set a default transport with `analysis.remote.transport` and optional per-target override via `analysis.remote.targets.<id>.transport`
- Set `analysis.remote.default_target` for default routing
- Keep `analysis.remote.local_fallback: true` to allow automatic local fallback if a remote target is unavailable
- Override target per request with `execution_target`

Detailed setup and troubleshooting: [docs/REMOTE_WINDOWS_TAILSCALE.md](docs/REMOTE_WINDOWS_TAILSCALE.md)

### Remote Credential Wizard (`.env.remote`)

You can store remote Windows credential metadata using the web wizard:

- `GET /setup/remote-credentials`
- `POST /setup/remote-credentials`
- `POST /setup/remote-credentials/delete`

Security behavior:

- Wizard access is restricted to localhost requests (`127.0.0.1` or `::1`)
- Save/delete requests require a setup token from `LITTERBOX_WIZARD_TOKEN`

Set token before starting LitterBox:

```bash
export LITTERBOX_WIZARD_TOKEN="replace-with-long-random-token"
python litterbox.py
```

Default credential path:

- `/opt/LitterBox/.env.remote`

Change default credential file path at startup:

```bash
export LITTERBOX_REMOTE_ENV_PATH="/opt/LitterBox/.env.remote.custom"
python litterbox.py
```

You can also override the credential file path per wizard request using the `env_path` field.

Per-target key format:

- `LB_REMOTE_TARGET_<TARGET_ID_UPPER_SNAKE>_HOST`
- `LB_REMOTE_TARGET_<TARGET_ID_UPPER_SNAKE>_DOMAIN`
- `LB_REMOTE_TARGET_<TARGET_ID_UPPER_SNAKE>_ACCOUNT_TYPE`
- `LB_REMOTE_TARGET_<TARGET_ID_UPPER_SNAKE>_USERNAME`
- `LB_REMOTE_TARGET_<TARGET_ID_UPPER_SNAKE>_PASSWORD`
- `LB_REMOTE_TARGET_<TARGET_ID_UPPER_SNAKE>_UPDATED_AT`

Runtime behavior:

- SSH targets continue to use key-based SSH settings from `Config/config.yaml`.
- WinRM targets consume credentials from `.env.remote` at runtime.
- Account normalization for WinRM:
  - `account_type=domain` => `DOMAIN\\username` (when domain is set)
  - `account_type=local` => `.\\username` unless username is already qualified
- If `domain` credentials are missing and `server2025` points to the same host, credentials are auto-migrated to `domain`.

## Client Libraries

For programmatic access to LitterBox, use the **GrumpyCats** package:

  * Standalone CLI utility for direct server interaction
  * Python library for integrating LitterBox capabilities into custom tools

* **LitterBoxMCP.py**: Specialized server component that:
  * Wraps the GrumpyCat library functionality
  * Enables LLM agents to interact with the LitterBox analysis platform
  * Provides natural language interfaces to malware analysis workflows
